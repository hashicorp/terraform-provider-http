kind: NOTES
body: 'data-source/http: Previously the HTTP request would unexpectedly always contain
  a body for all requests. Certain HTTP server implementations are sensitive to this
  data existing if it is not expected. Requests now only contain a request body if
  the `request_body` attribute is explicitly set. To exactly preserve the previous
  behavior, set `request_body = ""`.'
