## 3.4.2 (February 29, 2024)

NOTES:

* data-source/http: Previously the HTTP request would unexpectedly always contain a body for all requests. Certain HTTP server implementations are sensitive to this data existing if it is not expected. Requests now only contain a request body if the `request_body` attribute is explicitly set. To exactly preserve the previous behavior, set `request_body = ""`. ([#388](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-http/issues/388))

BUG FIXES:

* data-source/http: Ensured HTTP request body is not sent unless configured ([#388](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-http/issues/388))
