  The http resource makes an HTTP request to the given URL and exports
  information about the response.
  The given URL may be either an http or https URL. This resource
  will issue a warning if the result is not UTF-8 encoded.
  ~> Important Although https URLs can be used, there is currently no
  mechanism to authenticate the remote server except for general verification of
  the server certificate's chain of trust. Data retrieved from servers not under
  your control should be treated as untrustworthy.
  By default, there are no retries. Configuring the retry block will result in
  retries if an error is returned by the client (e.g., connection errors) or if
  a 5xx-range (except 501) status code is received. For further details see
  go-retryablehttp https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/go-retryablehttp.
