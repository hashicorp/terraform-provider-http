# http (Data Source)

The `http` data source makes an HTTP GET request to the given URL and exports
information about the response.

The given URL may be either an `http` or `https` URL. This resource
will issue a warning if the result is not UTF-8 encoded.

~> **Important** Although `https` URLs can be used, there is currently no
mechanism to authenticate the remote server except for general verification of
the server certificate's chain of trust. Data retrieved from servers not under
your control should be treated as untrustworthy.

By default, there are no retries. Configuring the retry block will result in
retries if an error is returned by the client (e.g., connection errors) or if 
a 5xx-range (except 501) status code is received. For further details see 
[go-retryablehttp](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/go-retryablehttp).

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataHttp } from "./.gen/providers/http/";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataHttp(this, "example", {
      request_headers: [
        {
          Accept: "application/json",
        },
      ],
      url: "https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform",
    });
    new DataHttp(this, "example_head", {
      method: "HEAD",
      url: "https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform",
    });
    new DataHttp(this, "example_post", {
      method: "POST",
      request_body: "request body",
      url: "https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform",
    });
  }
}

```

## Usage with Postcondition

[Precondition and Postcondition](https://www.terraform.io/language/expressions/custom-conditions)
checks are available with Terraform v1.2.0 and later.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformSelf, Fn, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataHttp } from "./.gen/providers/http/";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new DataHttp(this, "example", {
      lifecycle: {
        postcondition: [
          {
            condition: Fn.contains(
              [201, 204],
              TerraformSelf.getAny("status_code")
            ),
            errorMessage: "Status code invalid",
          },
        ],
      },
      request_headers: [
        {
          Accept: "application/json",
        },
      ],
      url: "https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform",
    });
  }
}

```

## Usage with Precondition

[Precondition and Postcondition](https://www.terraform.io/language/expressions/custom-conditions)
checks are available with Terraform v1.2.0 and later.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { DataHttp } from "./.gen/providers/http/";
import { Uuid } from "./.gen/providers/random/uuid";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataHttpExample = new DataHttp(this, "example", {
      request_headers: [
        {
          Accept: "application/json",
        },
      ],
      url: "https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform",
    });
    const randomUuidExample = new Uuid(this, "example_1", {
      lifecycle: {
        precondition: [
          {
            condition: Fn.contains([201, 204], dataHttpExample.statusCode),
            errorMessage: "Status code invalid",
          },
        ],
      },
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    randomUuidExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Usage with Provisioner

[Failure Behaviour](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/provisioners/syntax#failure-behavior)
can be leveraged within a provisioner in order to raise an error and stop applying.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Resource } from "./.gen/providers/null/resource";
import { DataHttp } from "./.gen/providers/http/";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    /*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: null.
    For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
    const dataHttpExample = new DataHttp(this, "example", {
      request_headers: [
        {
          Accept: "application/json",
        },
      ],
      url: "https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform",
    });
    const nullProviderResourceExample = new Resource(this, "example_1", {
      provisioners: [
        {
          type: "local-exec",
          command: Fn.contains([201, 204], dataHttpExample.statusCode),
        },
      ],
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    nullProviderResourceExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

## Schema

### Required

- `url` (String) The URL for the request. Supported schemes are `http` and `https`.

### Optional

- `caCertPem` (String) Certificate data of the Certificate Authority (CA) in [PEM (RFC 1421)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1421) format.
- `insecure` (Boolean) Disables verification of the server's certificate chain and hostname. Defaults to `false`
- `method` (String) The HTTP Method for the request. Allowed methods are a subset of methods defined in [RFC7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-4.3) namely, `GET`, `HEAD`, and `POST`. `POST` support is only intended for read-only URLs, such as submitting a search.
- `requestBody` (String) The request body as a string.
- `requestHeaders` (Map of String) A map of request header field names and values.
- `requestTimeoutMs` (Number) The request timeout in milliseconds.
- `retry` (Block, Optional) Retry request configuration. By default there are no retries. Configuring this block will result in retries if an error is returned by the client (e.g., connection errors) or if a 5xx-range (except 501) status code is received. For further details see [go-retryablehttp](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/go-retryablehttp). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--retry))

### Read-Only

- `body` (String, Deprecated) The response body returned as a string. **NOTE**: This is deprecated, use `response_body` instead.
- `id` (String) The URL used for the request.
- `responseBody` (String) The response body returned as a string.
- `responseBodyBase64` (String) The response body encoded as base64 (standard) as defined in [RFC 4648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-4).
- `responseHeaders` (Map of String) A map of response header field names and values. Duplicate headers are concatenated according to [RFC2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec4.html#sec4.2).
- `statusCode` (Number) The HTTP response status code.

<a id="nestedblock--retry"></a>
### Nested Schema for `retry`

Optional:

- `attempts` (Number) The number of times the request is to be retried. For example, if 2 is specified, the request will be tried a maximum of 3 times.
- `maxDelayMs` (Number) The maximum delay between retry requests in milliseconds.
- `minDelayMs` (Number) The minimum delay between retry requests in milliseconds.
