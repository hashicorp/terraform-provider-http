# http (Resource)

The `http` resource makes an HTTP request to the given URL and exports
information about the response.

The given URL may be either an `http` or `https` URL. This resource
will issue a warning if the result is not UTF-8 encoded.

~> **Important** Although `https` URLs can be used, there is currently no
mechanism to authenticate the remote server except for general verification of
the server certificate's chain of trust. Data retrieved from servers not under
your control should be treated as untrustworthy.

By default, there are no retries. Configuring the retry block will result in
retries if an error is returned by the client (e.g., connection errors) or if 
a 5xx-range (except 501) status code is received. For further details see 
[go-retryablehttp](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/go-retryablehttp).

## Example Usage

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ResourceHttp } from "./.gen/providers/http/";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new ResourceHttp(this, "example", {
      requestHeaders: [
        {
          Accept: "application/json",
        },
      ],
      url: "https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform",
    });
    new ResourceHttp(this, "example_head", {
      method: "HEAD",
      url: "https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform",
    });
    new ResourceHttp(this, "example_post", {
      method: "POST",
      requestBody: "request body",
      url: "https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform",
    });
  }
}

```

## Controlling when the request is sent

Use the resource argument `when` to control whether the HTTP request is executed during apply operations or only during destroy:

- `apply` (default): request is executed during create and update.
- `destroy`: request is executed only during resource destruction.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
import { ResourceHttp } from "./.gen/providers/http/";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new ResourceHttp(this, "cleanup", {
      method: "DELETE",
      url: "https://api.example.com/cleanup",
      when: "destroy",
    });
  }
}

```

## Usage with Postcondition

Note: Pre/postconditions validate values during apply. They are only meaningful when the resource executes the HTTP request during apply, i.e., when `when = "apply"` (default). If `when = "destroy"`, these conditions will not evaluate against a fresh request result.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { TerraformSelf, Fn, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ResourceHttp } from "./.gen/providers/http/";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new ResourceHttp(this, "example", {
      lifecycle: {
        postcondition: [
          {
            condition: Fn.contains(
              [201, 204],
              TerraformSelf.getAny("status_code")
            ),
            errorMessage: "Status code invalid",
          },
        ],
      },
      requestHeaders: [
        {
          Accept: "application/json",
        },
      ],
      url: "https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform",
      when: "apply",
    });
  }
}

```

## Usage with Precondition

Note: Pre/postconditions validate values during apply. They are only meaningful when the resource executes the HTTP request during apply, i.e., when `when = "apply"` (default). If `when = "destroy"`, these conditions will not evaluate against a fresh request result.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { ResourceHttp } from "./.gen/providers/http/";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const httpExample = new ResourceHttp(this, "example", {
      requestHeaders: [
        {
          Accept: "application/json",
        },
      ],
      url: "https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform",
      when: "apply",
    });
    httpExample.addOverride("lifecycle.precondition", [
      {
        condition: Fn.contains([200, 201, 204], httpExample.statusCode),
        errorMessage: "Unexpected status code",
      },
    ]);
  }
}

```

## Usage with Provisioner

[Failure Behaviour](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/provisioners/syntax#failure-behavior)
can be leveraged within a provisioner in order to raise an error and stop applying.

```typescript
// DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
import { Construct } from "constructs";
import { Fn, TerraformStack } from "cdktf";
/*
 * Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
 * See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
 */
import { Resource } from "./.gen/providers/null/resource";
import { ResourceHttp } from "./.gen/providers/http/";
class MyConvertedCode extends TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const httpExample = new ResourceHttp(this, "example", {
      requestHeaders: [
        {
          Accept: "application/json",
        },
      ],
      url: "https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform",
    });
    const nullProviderResourceExample = new Resource(this, "example_1", {
      provisioners: [
        {
          type: "local-exec",
          command: Fn.contains([201, 204], httpExample.statusCode),
        },
      ],
    });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    nullProviderResourceExample.overrideLogicalId("example");
  }
}

```

Configuring this block will result in retries if an error is returned by the client (e.g., connection errors) or if a 5xx-range (except 501) status code is received. For further details see [go-retryablehttp](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/go-retryablehttp). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--retry))
- `when` (String) When to send the HTTP request. Valid values are `apply` (default) and `destroy`. When set to `apply`, the request is sent during resource creation and updates. When set to `destroy`, the request is only sent during resource destruction.

### Read-Only

- `statusCode` (Number) The HTTP response status code.

<a id="nestedblock--retry"></a>
### Nested Schema for `retry`

Optional:

- `attempts` (Number) The number of times the request is to be retried. For example, if 2 is specified, the request will be tried a maximum of 3 times.
- `maxDelayMs` (Number) The maximum delay between retry requests in milliseconds.
- `minDelayMs` (Number) The minimum delay between retry requests in milliseconds.
