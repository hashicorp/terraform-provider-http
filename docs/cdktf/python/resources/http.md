# http (Resource)

The `http` resource makes an HTTP request to the given URL and exports
information about the response.

The given URL may be either an `http` or `https` URL. This resource
will issue a warning if the result is not UTF-8 encoded.

~> **Important** Although `https` URLs can be used, there is currently no
mechanism to authenticate the remote server except for general verification of
the server certificate's chain of trust. Data retrieved from servers not under
your control should be treated as untrustworthy.

By default, there are no retries. Configuring the retry block will result in
retries if an error is returned by the client (e.g., connection errors) or if 
a 5xx-range (except 501) status code is received. For further details see 
[go-retryablehttp](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/go-retryablehttp).

## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.http. import ResourceHttp
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ResourceHttp(self, "example",
            request_headers=[{
                "Accept": "application/json"
            }
            ],
            url="https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform"
        )
        ResourceHttp(self, "example_head",
            method="HEAD",
            url="https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform"
        )
        ResourceHttp(self, "example_post",
            method="POST",
            request_body="request body",
            url="https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform"
        )
```

## Controlling when the request is sent

Use the resource argument `when` to control whether the HTTP request is executed during apply operations or only during destroy:

- `apply` (default): request is executed during create and update.
- `destroy`: request is executed only during resource destruction.

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformStack
from imports.http. import ResourceHttp
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ResourceHttp(self, "cleanup",
            method="DELETE",
            url="https://api.example.com/cleanup",
            when="destroy"
        )
```

## Usage with Postcondition

Note: Pre/postconditions validate values during apply. They are only meaningful when the resource executes the HTTP request during apply, i.e., when `when = "apply"` (default). If `when = "destroy"`, these conditions will not evaluate against a fresh request result.

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import TerraformSelf, Fn, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.http. import ResourceHttp
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        ResourceHttp(self, "example",
            lifecycle={
                "postcondition": [{
                    "condition": Fn.contains([201, 204],
                    TerraformSelf.get_any("status_code")),
                    "error_message": "Status code invalid"
                }
                ]
            },
            request_headers=[{
                "Accept": "application/json"
            }
            ],
            url="https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform",
            when="apply"
        )
```

## Usage with Precondition

Note: Pre/postconditions validate values during apply. They are only meaningful when the resource executes the HTTP request during apply, i.e., when `when = "apply"` (default). If `when = "destroy"`, these conditions will not evaluate against a fresh request result.

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.http. import ResourceHttp
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        http_example = ResourceHttp(self, "example",
            request_headers=[{
                "Accept": "application/json"
            }
            ],
            url="https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform",
            when="apply"
        )
        http_example.add_override("lifecycle.precondition", [{
            "condition": Fn.contains([200, 201, 204], http_example.status_code),
            "error_message": "Unexpected status code"
        }
        ])
```

## Usage with Provisioner

[Failure Behaviour](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/provisioners/syntax#failure-behavior)
can be leveraged within a provisioner in order to raise an error and stop applying.

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.null.resource import Resource
from imports.http. import ResourceHttp
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        http_example = ResourceHttp(self, "example",
            request_headers=[{
                "Accept": "application/json"
            }
            ],
            url="https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform"
        )
        null_provider_resource_example = Resource(self, "example_1",
            provisioners=[{
                "type": "local-exec",
                "command": Fn.contains([201, 204], http_example.status_code)
            }
            ]
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        null_provider_resource_example.override_logical_id("example")
```

<a id="nestedblock--retry"></a>
### Nested Schema for `retry`

Optional:

- `attempts` (Number) The number of times the request is to be retried. For example, if 2 is specified, the request will be tried a maximum of 3 times.
