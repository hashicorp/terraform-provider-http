# HTTP Provider

The HTTP provider is a utility provider for interacting with generic HTTP
servers as part of a Terraform configuration.

### Configuring Proxy

```terraform
# This example makes an HTTP request to `website.com`
# via an HTTP proxy at `corporate.proxy.service`.

provider "http" {
  proxy {
    url = "https://corporate.proxy.service"
  }
}

data "http" "test" {
  url = "https://website.com"
}
```

```terraform
# This example makes an HTTP request to `website.com`
# via an HTTP proxy defined through environment variables (see
# https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ProxyFromEnvironment for details).

provider "http" {
  proxy {
    from_env = true
  }
}

data "http" "test" {
  url = "https://website.com"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `proxy` (Attributes) Proxy used by resources and data sources that connect to external endpoints. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--proxy))

<a id="nestedatt--proxy"></a>
### Nested Schema for `proxy`

Optional:

- `from_env` (Boolean) When `true` the provider will discover the proxy configuration from environment variables. This is based upon [`http.ProxyFromEnvironment`](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ProxyFromEnvironment) and it supports the same environment variables (default: `true`).
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password used for Basic authentication against the Proxy.
- `url` (String) URL used to connect to the Proxy. Accepted schemes are: `http`, `https`, `socks5`.
- `username` (String) Username (or Token) used for Basic authentication against the Proxy.
