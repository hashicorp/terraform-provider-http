# HTTP Provider

The HTTP provider is a utility provider for interacting with generic HTTP
servers as part of a Terraform configuration.

## Example Usage

This provider requires no configuration, but accepts an optional `host`
configuration.

### Providing host-specific configuration at the provider level

```terraform
# Ensure an 'Accept: application/json' header is present on all
# checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com requests.
provider "http" {
  # Optional host configuration
  host {
    name = "checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com"

    request_headers = {
      Accept = "application/json"
    }
  }
}

data "http" "example" {
  url = "https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform"
}
```

### Nested Schema for `host`

Required:

- `name` (String) The hostname for which the host configuration should
take affect. If the name matches an HTTP request URL's hostname, the provider's
host configuration takes affect (in addition to any data- or resource-specific
request configuration.

Optional:

- `request_headers` (Map of String, Sensitive) A map of request header field names and values to
include in HTTP requests if/when the request URL's hostname matches the provider
host configuration name.
