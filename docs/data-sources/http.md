# http (Data Source)

The `http` data source makes an HTTP GET request to the given URL and exports
information about the response.

The given URL may be either an `http` or `https` URL. At present this resource
can only retrieve data from URLs that respond with `text/*` or
`application/json` content types, and expects the result to be UTF-8 encoded
regardless of the returned content type header.

~> **Important** Although `https` URLs can be used, there is currently no
mechanism to authenticate the remote server except for general verification of
the server certificate's chain of trust. Data retrieved from servers not under
your control should be treated as untrustworthy.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# The following example shows how to issue an HTTP GET request supplying
# an optional request header.
data "http" "example" {
  url = "https://checkpoint-api.hashicorp.com/v1/check/terraform"

  # Optional request headers
  request_headers = {
    Accept = "application/json"
  }
}
```
